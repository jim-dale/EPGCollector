===============

	1.1 Overview		
	============

	This document gives detailed information on all the fields and settings that can be made when creating or changing collection
	parameters using EPG Centre.

	Most of the fields and settings are grouped by the tabs on which they appear in EPG Centre. Separate sections details those
	that occur on dialogs that can appear while filling in the tabs.
	
2. The Tuning Tab
=================

The tuning tab itself contains other tabs, one for each type of delivery system (eg satellite) plus a tab for file inputs (MPEG2
ts files) and a tab for streaming inputs. Only tabs that have the relevant hardware installed will be shown.

Any number of frequencies, files or streams can be selected. When a collection is run they will be processed in the order they
have been entered and the EPG data collected combined into a single output as defined on the Output tab.

Note that DVBLogic virtual tuners cannot be used for collections as do not pass the relevant control information from the 
broadcast data.

	2.1 DVB Satellite
	=================

		2.1.1 General settings
		======================
	
		Satellite

			Contains a list of all the satellites defined in the DVB-S configuration parameters.

		Frequency

			Once a satellite is selected contains the frequencies in kilohertz and the polarization
			defined for that satellite in the configuration parameters.

		Collection Type
	
			Once a frequency is selected contains the default data type for that frequency. However, any
			required collection type can be chosen.
			
		Sat>IP Frontend

			Allows the tuner to be selected when using a Sat>IP server. If this field is set to 'n/a' the Sat>IP server
			will use any available tuner.	

		LNB Low Band

			Set with the LNB low oscillator setting in kilohertz.

		LNB High Band

			Set with the LNB high band oscillator setting in kilohertz.

		LNB Switch

			Set with the LNB switch value in kilohertz. If you set the LNB switch value to zero, when the collection
			is run a very high number (20000000) is used to ensure the tuner driver does not turn on the 22kHz signal. This
			is consistent with other applications that control LNB's

		LNB Type

			This parameter is only relevant to North America and, in addition, will only be enabled for 
			those satellites with band stacking.

			It contains a list of the types of LNB available with the Dish or Bell TV networks.

			If Legacy is selected the tuning parameters are used as selected.

			If DSS or FSS is selected the frequency and polarization are adjusted as necessary prior to tuning. Conversion only
			occurs if the polarization for the selected frequency is linear horizontal or circular left. 

		Defaults

			There is a list of default LNB settings that are accessed by repeatedly pressing this button The list 
			represents the following
				
				9750000,  10600000, 11700000	standard universal LNB (commonly found in Europe)
				10750000, 10750000, 0		single oscillator LNB
				11300000, 11300000, 0		single oscillator LNB
				10700000, 10700000, 0		single oscillator LNB
				10600000, 10600000, 0		single oscillator LNB
				11250000, 11250000, 0		single oscillator LNB (North America)
			
		2.1.2 Tuners
		============
	
		The list shows the satellite tuners available. 

		If the option to use any available tuner is selected, when the collection is run the first tuner that is not in use 
		and is appropriate for the frequency being collected is used.

		Except in the case of Sat>IP tuners, EPG Collector requires exclusive access to the tuner during the collection process. This
		includes VBox servers.
		
		2.1.3 DiSEqC options
		====================

		Switch

			Specifies the DiSEqC switching requirements for multiple dish configurations.

			The list supports the following ports:

			1. Simple port A or B.
			2. Ports AA, AB, BA or BB. These use committed commands for switches supporting DiSEqC 1.0 and may 
			   also be known as ports A - D.
			3. Port 1 - 16. These use uncommitted commands for switches supporting DiSEqC 1.1.
			4. Port AA1 through AB4. These use a combination of committed and uncommitted commands for switches that 
			   support both DiSEqC 1.0 and 1.1.

			As an alternative you can enter custom DiSEqC commands in the box at the top of the list. Each command is 
			entered as a series of hex values with one or more spaces separating each byte. Multiple commands can be 
			entered separated by the ':' (colon) character. Multiple commands are transmitted to the switch separated by
			a 150 msec gap.

			So, for example, the uncommitted command to switch to port 2 would be entered as e0 10 39 01. DiSEqC commands
			specify port numbers starting from zero.

			Note that values entered manually are not validated. If the correct switching does not occur first check 
			the EPG Collector log which lists the DiSEqC commands as they are transmitted. If a manually entered value
			is formatted incorrectly the transmitted value will be seen in the log as a string of zeros.

		DiSEqC handler

			Normally EPG Collector will automatically select the correct handler for the tuner hardware so the entry
			in this list can be left at Default.

			However in special circumstances a specific selection can be made from this list. 

		Check tuner is not in use before changing DiSEqC switch

			With some tuner hardware it is possible to change a DiSEqC switch even though the tuner is in use by another
			program. 

			Select this option to ensure that can't happen.

		Repeat DiSEqC command if first attempt fails

			Some tuner drivers report an error on the first attempt to change a DiSEqC but change it correctly on a second
			attempt.

			Select this option if that is the case.

		Change DiSEqC switch only when graph running

			Some tuner drivers will only change a DiSEqC switch once the DirectShow graph that contains them is in the
			running state.

			Select this option is this is the case.

		Change DiSEqC switch only after tune request

			Some tuner drivers will only change a DiSEqC switch once the request to tune has already been made.

			Select this option is this is the case.

		Use DiSEqC commands instead of LNB source

			Some tuner drivers only change a DiSEqC switch using DiSEqC commands rather than the Windows API.

			Select this option if that is the case. This option is only relevant to the generic DiSEqC handler.

		Disable driver DiSEqC commands

			Some tuner drivers will send their own commands to a DiseQc switch causing EPG Collectors changes to fail.

			Select this option to stop that happening. This option is only relevant to the generic DiSEqC handler.

4. The Output Tab
=================

The output tab defines where the collected data should go and what processing should be applied prior to output. 

The various fields and options are used as follows:

	4.1 General Options
	===================

	Create data for channels with the same name if data not present

		Some broadcasters have channels with the same name on which they transmit the identical programmes with regionalised 
		advertising. The EPG data can sometimes be omitted for the duplicate stations to reduce bandwidth and selecting
		this option creates data for those channels that would otherwise not have any data.

		Restrictions: This option is currently only applicable to New Zealand terrestrial MHEG5 collections.	

	Round the programme times to the nearest 5 minutes

		If this option is selected programme times that are not multiples of 5 minutes will be adjusted. Any time up to 
		3 minutes over will be rounded down and any time over 3 minutes will be rounded up. The duration of the programme
		will be adjusted accordingly.

	Only output data if channel relevent

		Sometimes broadcasters transmit EPG data for channels that cannot be received (eg regional broadcasting). If this
		option is set that data is ignored during the collection process.

		Restrictions: This option is only relevant to DVB terrestrial and DVB cable transmissions.

	Don't remove extracted data from titles and descriptions

		The collection process scans programme titles and descriptions looking for information such as cast and series and
		episode information.

		If this information is located it is extracted into the relevant fields for output and removed from where it was
		found.

		If this option is selected it is not removed and will still be visible when the EPG data is viewed in a media player.

		Restrictions: This option is only relevant to MHEG5 and OpenTV data.

	Don't log small gaps between programmes

		Some broadcasters allow for the advert breaks in the EPG data. These will be reported as gaps in the collection log
		unless this option is selected.

	Don't log excluded channels

		Some types of data, notably Dish Network data, has a very large number of channels and most of them will be excluded
		from the collection.

		To reduce the length of the log and make it more readable select this option.

	Append season/episode numbers to description

		This option can be used where the broadcaster provides season and/or episode numbers in the broadcast stream and it they
		are to be added to the programme descption.

		Note that if they are already present in the description they will be duplicated.

	Don't create an output file if no data collected

		If this option is set and no data is collected, the output file will not exist. If it is not set and no data is collected
		an empty file will be created.
		

	4.2 TVSource Options
	====================

	Enabled

		Enable output direct to TVSource.

	Format of the channel ID

		Allows the format of the channel ID tag passed to TVSource to be defined. The possible values are:

			Service ID
			User channel number
			Sequential number
			Full channel identification

		The sequential number option numbers the first channel 1 and increments by 1 for each subsequent channel. Note that
		successive runs won't necessarily produce the same channel ID's.

		The user channel number may not available for all data types.

		The full channel identification option creates the channel ID tag with the network ID, transport stream ID, service ID
		and channel name. Use this format if the file is to be imported into another run of EPG Collector.
		
	4.2 XMLTV Options
	=================

	Enabled

		Enable XMLTV output.

	Path	
	
		The full path name of the XMLTV file to be created.

		The default file name is TVGuide.xml and it is placed in the data directory. It will overwrite any existing version
		each time a collection is run.

	Browse

		Enables a search for the path to be made.

	Channel logo path	
	
		The full path name of the user suppplied channel logos. The default path if the field is left blank is the Images 
		subdirectory of the data directory. The contents of the field are not validated.

		Any channel logos supplied by the user and pointed to by this field must have a filename of 'channel name.png'. 
		If the path begins with	'http://' or 'https://' the channel name will be correctly escaped for a URI.

		If the field is left blank and the user supplies icons in the default location the name of the file can be
		'service ID.png' as well as 'channel name.png'.

	Browse

		Enables a search for the channel logo path to be made.	

	Format of the channel ID

		Allows the format of the channel ID tag in the XMLTV file to be defined. The possible values are:

			Service ID
			User channel number
			Sequential number
			Full channel identification

		The sequential number option numbers the first channel 1 and increments by 1 for each subsequent channel. Note that
		successive runs won't necessarily produce the same channel ID's.

		The user channel number may not available for all data types.

		The full channel identification option creates the channel ID tag with the network ID, transport stream ID, service ID
		and channel name. Use this format if the file is to be imported into another run of EPG Collector.

	Format of the episode tag.

		Allows the format of the episode tag in the XMLTV file to be defined. The possible values are:

			Valid season and episode numbers only
			BSEPG compatible
			Full content reference ID
			Numeric part of content reference ID
			VBOX compatible
			Not output

		Valid season and episode numbers are not always available and depend on the data from the broadcaster.

		The options using the content reference ID are also dependent of the data broadcast. These options should
		be used if the software that processes the XMLTV file can use the episode tags in a non-standard format. The system
		attribute is set to 'crid' for the full content reference ID and 'numeric_crid' for the numeric format.

	Create an LCN tag containing the user channel number

		If this option is selected an 'lcn' element will be added to each channel in the XMLTV file containing the user
		channel number.

		The user channel number may not available for all data types.			

	Create an audio description tag

		If this option is selected an 'audio-description' element will be written to the XMLTV file indicating if an
		audio description is present in the data broadcast.

		This tag is not part of the XMLTV standard and is therefore only of use to any custom software that may
		process the XMLTV file.

	Output category elements in separate tags

		If this option is selected each element of a programme category will appear in the XMLTV file uder a separate
		tag.

	Omit part number from episode tag

		If this option is selected the part number will not be present in the episode tag if it is zero.
		
	Prefix description with air date
	
		If this option is set and the original air date is available it will prefix the description in the 
		output file.
		
	Prefix subtitle with season/episode number
	
		If this option is set and season and/or episode numbers are available they will prefix the subtitle if it
		is also available.
		
	Create Plex compatible tags
	
		The file will be created such that it is compatible with Plex. 

	4.3 Windows Media Center Options
	================================

	Enabled

		Enable direct output to Windows Media Center.

	Import name

		The import name is used to identify and group the channels involved in the import process to Windows Media Center. It 
		will appear in Windows Media Center if the channels are manually edited to link them to the EPG data.

		If multiple EPG collections of different sets of channels are imported to Windows Media Center it is essential that 
		each collection has a different import name. If this is not the case each succeeding collection will remove the
		channels from the previous collection and they will not be accessible in Windows Media Center.

		If this field is not completed the default name of 'EPG Collector' will be used.

	Series and repeats

		This field determins the data used to group series and control the recording of programme repeats. The possible values
		are:

			Not used

				The programme title is used to control the creation of series. All programmes with the same title will be 
				grouped into the same series.

				Programme repeats within a series will not be detected unless the Repeats tab is used.
			
			Use programme title to generate links
			
				The programme title is used to control the creation of series. All programmes with the same title will be 
				grouped into the same series.

				Programme repeats are detected using the programme title and season and episode numbers. If season and episode
				numbers are not available the programme description is used.
				
			Use broadcaster references to generate links
			
				The links from the broadcaster such as content reference ID's or series links will be used to group programmes
				into series.

				If broadcaster links are not available the programme title will be used.

				Programme repeats are detected using the same information. If content reference ID's or series links are not
				available season and episode numbers will be used. If they are not available the programme title, description and
				start time will be used.
				
				This is the most accurate way to group programmes into seasons and detect repeats.
				
		If this option is changed it may be necessary to re-initialize the Windows Media Center database.
		
		This option cannot be used at the same time as enabling the Repeats tab.

	Automatically map EPG data to channels

		If this option is selected the collection process interrogates the Windows Media Center database to enable it to
		link the data received with the channels defined in Windows Media Center.

		If this option is not selected it is necessary to use the Edit Channel function in Windows Media Center to manually
		link the data received with the channel defined in the Windows Media Center TV guide. This will only need to be 
		done once after the first data collection has been made or if the Windows Media Center database is recreated.

	Flag 4 star rated programmes as special

		If this option is set any programme that is rated as 4-star will be flagged with the special attribute and will 
		appear coloured orange in the programme guide.

		Note that star ratings are not always available from the broadcast data but may be downloaded using the metadata
		lookup feature (see section 4.3).

	Disable in-band guide loader

		Windows Media Center has it's own in-built EPG loader. In most cases it doesn't matter if this is running in
		addition to EPG Collector but in a some cases it can cause corruption of the programme guide.

		Selecting this option sets the registry entries that stop the built in EPG loader from running. Note that the 
		machine must be rebooted the first time EPG Collector is run with this setting for it to take effect.

	4.4 DVBViewer Options
	=====================

	Enabled

		Enable direct output to DVBViewer or the Recording Service.

	Create the output file in a format that can be processed by Xepg

		If this option is selected the tags in the XMLTV file will be created in the format expected by Xepg.

	Import the data to DVBViewer directly

		If this option is selected the data collected will be transferred directly into DVBViewer. An XMLTV file will
		not be created.

	Import the data to the Recording Service

		If this option is selected the data collected will be transferred directly into the DVBViewer Recording Service. An
		XMLTV file will not be created.

	Format data so that subtitle is visible

		Setting this option changes the layout of the program guide when viewed in DVBViewer or the Recording Service.

	Clear existing data before importing

		The option to import into the Recording Service must be selected for this option to be available. It will clear 
		existing EPG data from the Recording Service before the data just collected is imported.

		If this option is not selected the data just collected will be added or will overwrite existing data. In most cases
		selecting this option is the correct course of action.

	Use IP Address(es)

		Normally EPG Collector will import the data to the Recording Service on the local machine. This field enables the data
		to be loaded to any machine on the local network that is running the Recording Service.

		The field is entered as a list of semicolon delimited IP addresses with optional usernames and passwords if the
		port on the remote machine has been secured.

		IP address(username/password);IP address(username/password)....

		Note that if a list is entered and the local machine is to be included it is specified as 127.0.0.1

		Example

			127.0.0.1;192.168.0.30(myname/mypassword);192.168.0.31

		Three machines will be loaded including the local machine. The second machine requires a username and password as
		the port is secured.

		If this field is left blank EPG Collector will import to the local machine.

	Port

		Specifies the UDP port to use to transfer the data to the Recording Service. The default value is 8089. If this value
		does not match that set up in the Recording Service the import will fail.

		If a list of IP addresses is entered the same port must be used on all the machines.

5. The Files Tab
================

The Files tab enables additional files not related to EPG data to be created as a by-product of the collection process. Three
types of file can currently be created.

All three files need the broadcast data to contain channel specific information. If this information is not present the file 
cannot be created.

The files are created after the normal collection process is complete.	

	5.1 Area/region channel file
	============================

	   Enabled

		If this option is enabled an additional file  will be created containing cross-reference information that can 
		be used in other software to maintain channel information.		

	   Path

		The full path of the output file. If this field is left blank the file will be created in the application
		data directory with the name AreaRegionChannelInfo.xml.

	5.2 BladeRunner channel file
	============================

	    Enabled

		If this option is enabled an additional file will be created that can be used as input to the BladeRunner software.

	    Path

		The full path of the output file. If this field is left blank the file will be created in the application
		data directory with the name ChannelInfo.xml.

	5.3 SageTV frequency file
	=========================

	    Enabled

		If this option is enabled an additional file will be created that contains channel definitionas in the format
		required by SageTV.

		Important note:

		    If the file will contain channels carried over DVB-T2 it may be necessary to include all the DVB-T2 frequencies
		    from the broadcaster in a single collection to enable the correct frequency informarion to be collected.

		    This is definitely the case with DVB-T2 transmissions in the UK. 

	    Path

		The full path of the output file. If this field is left blank the file will be created in the application
		data directory with the name SageTV.frq.

	    Don't create channel if no EPG data present

		If this option is selected only channels that contain EPG data will be present in the frequency file.
		
	    Satellite number

		This field is only relevant to DVB-S and then only to multi-satellite installations. It should be set to the
		SageTV satellite number for the satellite being processed.

6. The Channels Tab
===================

The Channels tab enables channels to be excluded, renamed and/or renumbered on an indivdual basis. It is used for those broadcasts
that contain small numbers of channels and should be used instead of the Filters tab in that situation.

The list is initially empty. To fill it complete the Tuning tab with the frequencies to scan and then press the Start Scan button.

All the frequencies selected will be scanned and the list filled with the channels located. They can then be excluded, renumbered
or renamed.

If a channel scan has already been carried out for the Timeshift tab it is not necessary to scan again and the list will appear
already filled.

	6.1 Channel list
	================

	Excluded

		If selected omits the channel from the collection process.

	Channel number

		The user channel number. A new number can be entered if required and will appear in any XMLTV file if the option
		to output user channel numbers in place of the service ID is chosen.

	New name

		The new name of the channel. This field is optional and if it is entered will be output to the XMLTV file in place
		of the original channel name.

	6.2 Buttons
	===========

	Start/Stop Scan

		Starts or stops scanning of the frequencies entered on the Tuning tab for channel information.

		Each attempt at scanning will add any new channels to the list. New frequencies can be entered on the Tuning tab and
		the Start Scan button used as often as required.

	Clear

		Clears the list.

	Include all

		Clears all the excluded settings.

	Exclude all

		Sets all the excluded settings.

	Ignore tuning errors

		When there are many entries in the list to be scanned it is sometimes useful to ignore errors that would require user
		intervention. Setting this option inhibits the message to the user when tuning fails.

		The EPG Collector log can be viewed to determine which frequencies failed to tune.

7. The Filters Tab
==================

The Filters tab enables channels to be excluded on a bulk basis. It is used for those broadcasts that contain large numbers of 
channels and should be used instead of the Channels tab in that situation. 

Channels that are to be included in the collection process are specified on this tab with all others being excluded.

The various fields and options are used as follows:

	7.1 Included Channels
	=====================

	Frequency

		The frequency the filter is to be applied to. This field is only relevant when a single collection run has
		multiple frequencies.

		The list will contain all the frequencies entered on the Tuning tab.

	Original network ID

		The original network ID of the channels to be included in the collection process. This field is optional.

		If it is present all the channels that have a matching original network ID and satisfy any other fields 
		entered will be included in the collection process. 

	Transport stream ID

		The transport stream ID of the channels to be included in the collection process. This field is optional.

		If it is present all the channels that have a matching transport stream ID and satisfy any other fields 
		entered will be included in the collection process. 		

	Start service ID

		The first service ID of a range of channels to be included in the collection process. This field is optional.

		If it is present all the channels that have a service ID less than it and satisfy any other fields entered
		will be included in the collection process. 

		If it is ommited the end service ID field cannot be entered.

	End service ID

		The last service ID of a range of channels to be included in the collection process. This field is optional.

		If it is present all the channels that fall within the range of the start and end service ID's and
		satisfy any other fields entered will be included in the collection process. 

		If it is ommited the start service ID field cannot be entered.

	Add
		Creates a new entry from the fields completed and adds it to the list.

	Delete

		Deletes entries from the list. This button will be available when an entry is selected.

	7.2 Miscellaneous
	=================

	Maximum service ID

		This field is optional and specifies the maximum service ID for channels that are to be included in the
		collection process.

		If it omitted there is no restriction on the maximum service ID that will be accepted.


8. The Timeshift Tab
====================

The timeshift tab enables data to be created for time shifted channels (eg +1 channels) when the broadcaster doesn't provide 
any. It is necessary to fill in the Tuning tab before data can be entered on this tab.

If a channel scan has already been carried out on the Channels tab the results will appear in the Source Channel and Destination
Channel lists. Otherwise it is necessary to use the Scan button to scan for channels using the data set up on the Tuning tab. 

A source and destination channel are selected and the offset in hours selected. The data is then added to the list at the bottom
of the tab using the Add button.

Any number of entries can be added to the list and the same channel can be used as a source as often as required.

The various fields and options are used as follows:

	8.1 Channels
	============

	Source Channel

		Contains a list of the channels that have been found by scanning the frequencies entered on the Tuning tab. Defines
		where the EPG data is to come from.

	Destination Channel

		Contains a list of the channels that have been found by scanning the frequencies entered on the Tuning tab. Defines
		which channel the EPG data is created for.

	Offset

		Defines the adjustment needed in hours from the source channel to the destination channel.

	Add

		Adds the current data to the list at the bottom of the tab.

	8.2 Selected Channels
	=====================

	Channel list

		Contains an entry for each offset channel that has been added.

	Delete

		Enables entries to be deleted from the list. The button will be available if an entry in the list is 
		selected.

	8.3 Buttons
	===========

	Start/Stop Scan

		Starts or stops scanning of the frequencies entered on the Tuning tab for channel information.

		Each attempt at scanning will add any new channels to the list. New frequencies can be entered on the Tuning tab and
		the Start Scan button used as often as required.
	
	Ignore tuning errors

		When there are many entries in the list to be scanned it is sometimes useful to ignore errors that would require user
		intervention. Setting this option inhibits the message to the user when tuning fails.

		The EPG Collector log can be viewed to determine which frequencies failed to tune.
  

9. The Repeats Tab
==================

The Repeats tab contains data that controls the repeat checking process. This marks programmes as repeats and can be used to
avoid duplicate recordings.

The repeat checking process uses the programme title and description to identify repeats. In some cases this may cause programmes
to be flagged as repeats even though they are not.

For example, a daily news programme could always have the same title and description even though the contents are different each
day. In that case, if it is required to record the program it may be advisable to define the programme in this tab to avoid each
programme being flagged as a repeat.

The various fields and options are used as follows:

	9.1 Options
	===========

	Check for programme repeats

		If this option is selected the programme information collected will be checked to determine if a programme is being
		re-broadcast.

		The result depends on the output method.

		If an XMLTV file is created the previous play date tag will be created where appropriate. If Windows Media Center 
		direct import is selected the original air date will be created and if data is passed directly to TVSource by the
		DVBLogic plugin the appropriate tag is used.

		Repeats are detected by using the programme information to match against the data received and, if Windows
		Media Center is installed, by checking the existing programme recordings.

	Don't flag simulcast programmes as repeats

		If this option is selected, programmes that would have been flagged as repeats that are broadcast on the
		same date and at the same time but on a different channel will not be flagged as repeats.

		Note that if the programme also occurs earlier in the data collected both simulcast programmes will be flagged
		as repeats.

	Ignore Windows Media Center recordings

		If this option is set any existing Windows Media Center recrodings are not included in the repeat checking
		process.

		This option may need to be set if a switch has been made to another media player (eg DVBViewer) and any existing
		recordings are no longer relevant.

	9.2 Exclusions
	==============

	Title

		All or part of the title of the programme. This field is optional but if it is omitted the description field must 
		be completed.

		Partial matching is specified in the following ways

			<text 		will match the text with the start of the title
			text>		will match the text with the end of the title
			<text>		will match the text with anywhere in the title

		If none of the above are specified the data entered must exactly match the programme title. All comparisons are
		case insensitive.

	Description

		All or part of the description of the programme. This field is optional but if it is omitted the title field must 
		be completed.

		Partial matching is specified in the following ways

			<text 		will match the text with the start of the description
			text>		will match the text with the end of the description
			<text>		will match the text with anywhere in the description

		If none of the above are specified the data entered must exactly match the programme description. All comparisons are
		case insensitive.

	Add

		Adds the title and/or the description to the list of programmes to be excluded from the repeat checking process.

	Delete

		Enables programmes already in the list to be deleted. The button will only be available after an entry is 
		selected.

	Phrases to ignore

		Sometimes the title or description of a repeated programme is slightly different from the original. This field
		enables phrases to be ignored when examining titles and descriptions for a match.

		Multiple phrases can be entered in which case they are separated by a comma. The phrases are processed in a case
		insensitive manner.

		The phrases (R) and (Repeat) are ignored by default and do not need to be entered.

10. The Edit Tab
================

The Edit tab contains options and fields that are used to replace or remove text from programme titles and descriptions. 
Broadcasters often embellish titles and descriptions with text (eg New Series) that is unnecessary and can cause series recording
and duplicate recording detection to fail. It can also reduce the success rate of metadata lookup.

The various fields and options are used as follows:

	10.1 Current Entry
	==================

	Text to change

		The text in the title or description that is to be replaced or removed. This field is case sensitive so the text
		New Series is not the same as New series.

	Apply to

		Defines the fields to apply the editing to. If in doubt select Titles and descriptions.

	Location

		Defines where in the title and/or the description the text to change is searched for. Most embellishments occur
		at the start of a title or description.

	Replacement text

		The text that replaces the text to change. If the text to change is to be removed rather than replaced leave
		this field blank.

	Add

		Adds the entry to the list of text edits.

	10.2 List Of Text Edits
	=======================

	Entries are added to this list when the Add button is pressed.

	Delete	Deletes the selected entry from the list. Select an entry from the list by clicking on it. 

11. The Lookups Tab
===================

The Lookups tab contains data that controls the downloading of programme metadata from online databases. Information for movies
and TV series can be downloaded.

	11.1 Movie Lookup
	=================

	Enabled

		Enables the lookup of movie information.

	Type of image to download

		Poster				Downloads a full size portrait poster
		Thumbnail			Downloads a smaller portrait poster
		None				No image downloaded

	Minimum duration of a programme to be considered a movie

		It is not always possible to determine that a programme is a movie from the information that is broadcast as
		not all broadcast data is categorized. This parameter enables a more general check to detect a programme as a
		movie.

		The minimum programme duration is entered in minutes.

	Maximum duration of a programme to be considered a movie

		It is not always possible to determine that a programme is a movie from the information that is broadcast as
		not all broadcast data is categorized. This parameter enables a more general check to detect a programme as a
		movie.

		The maximum programme duration is entered in minutes.

	Phrases used to identify a movie

		This field is used to enter phrases that may help to identify a programme as a movie. For example if
		the field is entered as

			Movie,Premiere:,Blockbuster

		then any programme title with the word Movie, Premiere: or Blockbuster will be looked up in the movie internet
		database.

		Note that these phrases are checked only if the minimum and maximum duration excludes a programme as a movie.

	Separator

		The normal separator for phrases used to identify a movie is a comma. If it is necessary to specifiy a comma 
		in any phrase use a different separator character and select it with this field.

	Programmes that are not movies

		Sometimes it is necessary to indicate that a programme is definitely not a movie and should be processed as a
		TV series even if it fits the criteria for a movie. This list fulfills that purpose.
		
	Change
		
		Enables the list of programmes that are not movies to be maintained. 

	11.2 TV Lookup
	==============

	Enabled

		Enables the lookup of TV series information.

	Type of image to download

		Poster				Downloads a full size portrait poster
		Banner				Downloads a full size banner
		Fanart				Downloads a full size landscape poster
		Thumbnail poster	Downloads a smaller portrait poster
		Thumbnail fanart	Downloads a smaller landscape poster
		None				No image downloaded

	Process every programme that is not a movie as a TV series

		The metadata lookup process checks each programme to determine if it is a movie first and the lookup parameters
		described above aid in this process.

		If a programme is not considered a movie or cannot be found in the movie database it is examined to determine 
		if it is a TV series. This means that a series link, a content reference ID or season/episode numbers need
		to be present in the broadcast data.

		If there is no automatic way of determining that a programme is a TV series, setting this option will cause
		every programme that is not considered a movie to be checked against the TV series database.

		Setting this option will normally increase the processing time but it ensures that all potential TV series are 
		processed.

	11.3 Miscellaneous
	==================

	Reload all metadata

		Setting this option causes all existing local metadata including posters and thumbnails to be deleted before
		the lookup process begins resulting in a complete reload of the data.

	Always lookup programmes that return no matching entries

		The online database that are used are dynamic in nature as they are constantly being updated by the user
		community. Normally when a programme is not located by the lookup process it will not be searched for again
		in the current or subsequent collections.

		Setting this option overrides that processing and ensures that the programme will be looked up during 
		subsequent collections. This means that the lookup times will be increased but there may be more data successfully
		downloaded.

	Ignore categories from broadcaster

		Sometimes, when the broadcasts contain program categories, they are inaccurate. For example serials or soaps
		are categorised as Movies and this results in the wrong internet database being accessed when looking up metadata.

		Setting this option causes any broadcast category to be ignored when deciding whether a programme is a movie or 
		TV series.	

	Lookup matching method when multiple results returned

		The online databases are accessed using the title of the programme. In many cases this results in a list of
		programmes being returned and the lookup process scans this list using the method selected for this field.

		'Exact' means that the title of a returned entry must exactly match the programme title. If there is no entry
		returned that satisfies this condition no metadata is added. This option results in the most accurate
		matching but the lowest hit rate.

		'Contains' means that the title of a returned entry must contain the programme title somewhere but it need not
		be an exact match. The returned entry that contains the programme title and is nearest in length to the programme
		title will be used for adding metadata. This option is less accurate than 'Exact' but has a better hit rate.

		'Nearest' uses a fuzzy matching algorithm so that the returned entry that most closely matches with the programme
		title will be used to add metadata. This is the least accurate option but results in the highest hit rate.

		'Exact' and 'Contains' may mean that no returned entry is used. 'Nearest' always uses one of the returned
		entries.

	Threshold for nearest matching

		If the matching method is selected as 'nearest' a threshold for returning a hit can be set.

		A value of zero means that as long as the online database returns some possible candidates one will be selected
		as the result irrespective of how close it matches the programme.

		Setting the threshold can reduce the number of mistaken hits. A lower value is more selectective than a high 
		value and it is normally not necessary to go above 10-15 as very few programmes would then result in no
		cnadidate being selected ie a high value gives similar results to a value of zero.

	Phrases used to ignored when matching

		Broadcasters ofter decorate programme titles with phrases such as 'Premiere' or 'Movie:'. These cause the database
		lookups to fail to return any entries.

		This field enables phrases to be specified that are removed from the programme tite before the internet databases
		are accessed.

		A good examples is 

			Movie:,All New,: The Final Season,Best Of,Omnibus

		Note that data entered on the Edit tab need not be entered again here.

	Separator

		The normal separator for phrases to be ignored is a comma. If it is necessary to specifiy a comma in any phrase
		use a different separator character and select it with this field.

	Maximum time allowed for lookup processing

		Set this parameter to a high value for the initial collections until the EPG Collector log indicates that the 
		lookup process completed rather than timed out. At this point all available information for the current set of
		EPG entries will have been downloaded.

		Then reduce this parameter to a lower value. Trial and error will indicate the correct value to use under normal
		circumstances for the volume of data you are collecting.

	Maximum number of consecutive errors before abandoning

		This parameter is used to stop lookup processing in the event of an irrecoverable error while accessing the online
		databases. For example, it would stop the lookup processing if the machine became disconnected from the internet.

		The default value of 5 is normally sufficient.

	Base path for movie and TV images

		This field can be set to point to a location for storing the downloaded images. The movie images will be stored
		in a sub-directory named Movies and the TV series will be stored in a sub-directory named TV Series (unless the
		option to store the images in the base path is set - see below)

		If this field is not entered the default will be the Images sub-directory of the application data directory.

	Browse

		Use this button to find the base directory for the movie and TV images.

	XMLTV image tag path

		Under certain circumstances when importing an XMLTV file to DVBLink it is necessary to set a specific
		path in the XMLTV file for image tags so that images are correctly processed by DVBLink.

		Normally the XMLTV file will contain the full path to the image but this field can be used to replace the path
		prefix. When the XMLTV tag is created, if this field is present it will be used as follows

			XMLTV image tag path/Movies/image file name or
			XMLTV image tag path/TV Series/image file name
			
	Store images in base path
	
		If this option is set both movie and TV images will be stored in the base path rather than in either the
		movie or TV series sub-directories.
		
	Name images from programme title
	
		Normally movie and TV series images are assigned a GUID that is used as the filename for storing the image. If
		this option is set the images are stored using the progamme title that appears in the EPG instead.
		
		Any characters in the programme title that are not valid filename characters (eg colon) are replaced by a space
		character. 

12. The Imports Tab
===================

The Imports tab enables files conforming to the XMLTV or MXF specification to be merged with the data received over the air. If
MXF files are selected thaey must have been created by EPG Collector or BSEPG.

Any number of files can be specified.

Channels loaded from the files can be excluded, renamed or have a user channel number assigned to them in the same way
as if they had been scanned over the air.

	12.1 File
	=========

	Path	
		
		The full path name of the XMLTV or MXF file.

	Browse

		Enables the file to be searched for.

	Language

		Selects the language to use for a multi-language file. If the file only contains a single language this field can
		be set to undefined. Only applies to XMLTV files.

		If the language cannot be located in the XMLTV tags then the first tag without a language will be used.

	Precedence

		Specifies which data takes precedence if an imported programme also exists in the broadcast data.

	Format of the channel ID

		Specifies the format of the channel ID tag in an XMLTV file
		
		Undefined
		
			The format of the tag is unknown.
			
		Service ID
		
			The channel ID tag specifies the service ID of the channel. The channel will be created with the original network
			ID and the transport stream ID set to -1.
			
		User channel number
		
			The channel ID tag specifies the user channel number of the channel. The channels will be created with a sequential
			service ID and the original network	ID and the transport stream ID set to -1. 
			
		Full channel identification
		
			The channel ID tag is in the format created by EPG Collectro when it creates an XMLTV file
			
				original network ID : transport stream ID : service ID : channel name
				
			This format of the tag enables the imported channel to be created exactly as if it had been detected in data
			received in the broadcast.
			
		Channel name
		
			The channel name is used to identify the channel. This option is designed to import files create by the WebGrab
			utility.

	No lookups

		Select this option if the imported file already contains comprehensive metadata. If metadata lookup processing
		is enabled it will ignore any EPG entries from the file.
		
	Append data
	
		Setting this option causes any data imported to be added to the end of existing data for 'non-precedent' data. The
		data will be merged if this option is not set. 

	Add

		Adds the file to the list of files to process.

	12.2 Selected Files
	===================

	File list

		The list of files to be processed.

	Delete

		Deletes the selected file from the list.

	12.3 Channel Changes
	====================

	Load this list after the files have been specified by pressing the Load Files button.

	Display Name
	
		The name of the channel.

	Excluded

		Select this option to ignore the channel.
	
	Channel Number

		The user channel number.

	New Name

		The new name of the channel.

	Load Files

		Loads the specified import files so they can be excluded, renamed or have a user channel number assigned. If no channels
		are to be excluded, renamed of have channel numbers assigned it is not necessary to use this button.

	Clear

		Clears the list.

	Include All

		Clears the excluded flag for all channels in the list.

	Exclude All

		Flags all the channels in the list as excluded.

13. The Update Tab
==================

The Update tab is used to enable and configure the automatic channel update feature for DVBLogic. The various fields and options
are used as follows:

	Enabled

		Switches the channel update feature on or off.

	Channel merge method for new channels

		Determines how new channels are added to the DVBLogic configuration files.

		None - new channels are simply added to the end of the configuration files. No channel merging takes palce.

		By name - new channels will be merged with existing channels if the channel name matches.

		By channel number - new channels will be merged with existing channels if the channel number matches.

		By channel name and number - new channels will be merged with existing channels if the channel name and number matches.

	EPG scanner for new channels

		Determines how EPG data is collected for new channels

		None - no EPG will be collected for the channel

		Default - EPG will be collected from the source for the channel

		EPG Collector - the EPG collector plugin will be set as the source of EPG data for new channels

		EIT Scanner - the DVBLogic EIT scanner will be set as the source of EPG data for the channel.

	Child lock on new channels

		Enables the child lock to be set on any new channel.

	EPG scan interval

		The default scan interval used by TVSource for collecting EPG data is 12 hours. This field can be used to 
		alter that value.

	Update channel numbers

		If this option is set the channel numbers received from the broadcaster will be used to set the channel numbers
		in the DVBLogic configuration files.

		Do not set this option if you have used custom channel numbers as they will be overwritten.

	Log the providers transponders and channels

		Additional information is output to the EPG Collector log file and collection window if this option is set.

	Reload all DVBLink channel data

		If this option is set all existing DVBLink channel information is overwritten with the data received in the
		broadcast.

	Automatically exclude new channels

		If this option is set new channels are not added to the DVBLink configuration but are instead added to the 
		current collection parameters as excluded channels.

		EPG Centre can then be used to flag the channels as not excluded. When the next collection involving a channel 
		update is run the channels will be added to the DVBLink configuration files in the normal way.

		This option is useful if the broadcaster adds large numbers of new channels but only a small number of them are
		to be added to the DVBLink configuration.	

14. The Advanced Tab
====================

The Advanced tab contains options and fields that are relatively rarely used. The various fields and options are used as follows:

	14.1 Miscellaneous Options
	==========================

	Don't monitor the keyboard during a collection

		Set this option if the standalone collection process is going to be run from a Windows service.

		If this option is set it is not possible to abandon a standalone collection while it is running by pressing the 'Q' key on
		the keyboard.

	Retain channel information for use in later collections

		Some broadcasters transmit channel information specific to each frequency even though the EPG data broadcast on
		each frequency is for all the broadcasters channels.

		For example frequency X defines channels 1 to 10 but carries the EPG data for channels 1 to 30. Frequency Y defines
		channels 11 to 30 and also carries the EPG data for channels 1 to 30.

		This can mean extended collection times as several frequencies need to be scanned to get the channel information
		even though all the EPG data could be collected from a single frequency.

		Using this option can reduce the collection to a single frequency.

		It should be set and a collection run for each of the individual frequencies. The collection process will then have
		created a single file with all the channels from the separate frequencies.

		Then, for the regular collection on a single frequency, this option should not be selected and the option below 
		set to use the stored channel information.

		If the channels on a particular frequency change repeat the whole procedure.

	Use retained channel information in place of broadcast data

		If this option is set the channel information stored when the previous option was set (Retain channel information
		for use in later collections) is used instead of obtaining it from the broadcast data.

	14.2 Timeouts
	=============

	Signal lock

		This is the length of time in seconds that a collection waits for the tuner hardware to acquire a lock on
		a frequency.

	Data collection
 
		This is the length of time in seconds that a collection is allowed to take. If a collection consists of
		multiple frequencies it is the maximum time allowed for each individual frequency.

	Number of retries

		With some types of collection data it is not possible to determine from the broadcast that all data has been
		collected. In this case collection process uses the number of retries to determine if any new data has
		been collected and if not the collection terminates normally.

		Each retry takes 2 seconds. Increase the number of retries if it appears that not all the data expected
		is being collected.

	Buffer size

		The data collection process uses a memory buffer to receive the broadcast data. The default size is 
		50 megabytes.

		Normally this is sufficient but Dish Network collections involve very large amounts of data so this
		buffer size should be increased to 500 megabytes.

	Buffer refills

		This parameter informs the collection process how many times it should refill the buffer used for
		broadcast data before it can be assumed that all possible data has arrived. The default of 1 is
		normally sufficient especially if the buffer size is increased from the default of 50 megabytes.

	Defaults

		Resets all the timeouts to the default values of 10 seconds, 300 seconds and 5 retries respectively.

	14.3 Manual Time Adjustment 
	===========================

	Enabled

		Allows manual time adjustment data to be entered. This is only required when data is collected in one 
		time zone but is used in another. 

		For example, Australia has different time zones so if data is collected and an XMLTV file is created in 
		one time zone but then passed to a machine for use in another time zone these parameters will need to be entered 
		or program times will be incorrect in the destination time zone.

		By default a collection uses the time zone data held by the machine making the collection so these parameters
		do not need to be entered.		 

	Current time offset

		Allows the current time offset to be entered. 

	Next time offset

		Allows the next time offset to be entered. 

	Date of change

		Allows the date at which the change to the next time offset takes place.

	Time of change

		Allows the time at which the change to the next time offset takes place.

15. The Diagnostics Tab
=======================

The Diagnostics tab should only be used under the direction of the developer. It enables many debugging options to be switched on
or log files produced.

The various fields and options are used as follows:

	Diagnostics
	===========

	Debug ID's

		Can be set with one or more identifiers that cause a single diagnostic event to be triggered (eg logging some
		data). The identifiers are separated by commas.

	Trace ID's

		Can be set with one or more identifiers that cause multiple diagnostic events to be triggered (eg logging data
		from a broadcast as it is received). The identifiers are separated by commas.

16. Dialogs
===========

	16.1 The Advanced frequency parameters
	======================================

	The Advanced frequency parameters dialog is displayed when the Update button is used on any of the Tuning tabs. It
	enables advanced parameters specific to the frequency, file or stream to be selected.

	Only those fields that are applicable to the frequency and collection type will be available. All other fields will
	be disabled. 

		16.1.1 Miscellaneous Options
		============================

		Use program category subtype when decoding

			For some protocols the program category consists of 2 values, the main category (eg Movies) and a subcategory
			(eg Action).

			If this option is not selected only the main category will be used for decoding the category for output which gives
			a more generalised catgeory.

			If the option is selected both the category and subcategory will be used for decoding resulting in a more precise
			category on output.

			Restrictions: EIT and Dish Network protocols only

		Use FreeSat Huffman tables to translate compressed EIT text

			A few FreeSat channels broadcast text in a compressed format. Use this option if that text is to be decoded. If the
			channels are decoded and this option is not set the text for those channels will be corrupted.

			Restrictions: Only relevant to a few BBC channels on FreeSat


		Custom program categories override broadcast categories

			If is possible to define custom program categories that are in addition to those broadcast. If this option is set
			and a custom category is defined that clashes with a broadcast category, the custom category definition will be
			used.

			If this option is not set the broadcast category will be used irrespective of whether there is a clash with a custom
			category.

		Process all channels irrespective of type

			If this option is set only channel type zero is ignored. All others are processed. If this option is not
			set channel type 12 (data broadcast service) is excluded as well.

		Extract channel logos from broadcast data

			If this option is selected the channel logos, broadcast as part of the EPG data, will be extracted and stored
			and referenced in the XMLTV file or loaded directly into Windows Media Center.
			
		Create channels from data if they don't exist

			 This option is used for SPTS (single program transport streams) where there is no channel information present but
			 where it is possible to create the channel data from the EPG data.
			 
		Match EPG data with channel using service ID only
		
			Normally EIT EPG data is matched with a channel using network ID, transport stream ID and service ID but occasionally
			the network ID and transport stream ID are incorrect and would result in the EPG data being discarded.
			
			Setting this option causes the matching process to use just the service ID. Note that this means that if this option
			is set service ID's must be unique within the EIT collection.			

		Maximum number of days to collect

			This parameter can be used to restrict the number of days data collected.
			
		Process text formatting characters

			This option controls the processing of format codes that may be present in the text portion of EPG data.

			'Remove' will cause any format code to be removed from the text. This is the default setting.
		
			'Replace with space' will cause any format code to be replaced by a single space.
		
			'Convert' will attempt to convert the format code to a meaningful value. The only format code currently 
			converted is 0x8a which is converted to 2 bytes with the value 0x0d, 0x0a (carriage	return and line feed). All
			other format codes are removed.

			'Use byte conversion table' will use the conversion table selected in the field below to convert the format
			byte to an alternative value.

		Byte conversion table

			This field enables custom control codes in EPG text data to be converted to meaningful values. The conversion
			tables are located in the file 'Byte Conversion Tables.cfg' located in the Configuration directory.

			As mentioned above, the tables can also be used to translate formatting codes.

		Use the programme description as

			This option controls how the programme description and extended description that is broadcast  with the EIT
			protocol is processed.

				Default    
				
					The description and extended description are processed in the standard manner and 
					concatenated together.
			
				Category
				
					The description is used as the programme category and the extended description is used as the
					programme description. At the present time this only applies to Multichoice broadcasts in
					South Africa.

				Subtitle
				
					The description is used as the programme subtitle and the extended description is used as the
					programme description.

				Ignore

					The description is ignored.

		Carousel profile

			This option is only available for EIT collections. It can be used for CanalSat and Horizon Switzerland
			data where it is broadcast in a non-standard zipped EIT format.

				Not used

					The default value.

				CanalSat

					Select for CanalSat data.

				UPC Horizon

					Select for Horizon Switzerland.

		16.1.2 Location Information
		===========================

			Country

				Contains a list of countries that can affect how EPG data is processed.				
	
			Area

				The list will be filled with areas when a country is selected with data loaded from the configuration files. The
				area and possibly region can be used to limit the channels processed.				

			Region

				The list will be filled with regions when an area is selected.

			Character Set

				Some broadcasters transmit data that is encoded in a specific character set but do not include the information 
				that enables a collection to determine what the	character set is.

				In those circumstances this field can be used to force a collection to decode the text received using a specific
				character set.

			Character Set Priority

				This field influences the selection of the character set for decoding text.

				If it is set to 'User selection' the character set selected by the user or the default character set (Western
				European (ISO))	will be used to translate text and any character set from the broadcaster will be ignored.

				If it set to 'Broadcast data' the character set specified by the broadcaster will be used if one is present. If 
				the broadcaster	has not specified a character set the character set specified by the user will be used and finally,
				if the user	has not specified a character set the default character set of Western European(ISO) will be used.

			Input Language

				Some broadcasts contain text in multiple languages. This field enables a specific language to be selected. If this
				parameter is not set and multiple languages are received the last one received will be used.

		16.1.3 Custom PID's
		===================

		Hexadecimal Values

			Enables the custom PID's to be entered in hexadecimal. The default is decimal.

		SDT
		
			Enables the PID that is used to transmit SDT (service description) data to be specified. This field is only needed 
			if the SDT data is not transmitted on PID 0x11.

		EIT
		
			Enables the PID that is used to transmit EIT (event information) data to be specified. This field is only needed if 
			the EIT data is	not transmitted on PID 0x12.
	
		MediaHighway1

			Enables the 2 PID's that are used to transmit MediaHighway1 data to be specified. They must be specified in
			ascending order. This field is only needed if the data is not transmitted on PID's 0xd2 and 0xd3.

		MediaHighway2

			Enables the 3 PID's that are used to transmit MediaHighway2 data to be specified. They must be specified in
			ascending order. This field is only needed if the data is not transmitted on PID's 0x231, 0x234 and 0x236.

		Dish Network
		
			Enables the PID that is used to transmit Dish Network data to be specified. This field is only needed if the 
			Dish Network data is not transmitted on PID 0x300.

	16.2 Maintain the 'not a movie' list
	====================================

	This dialog maintains the list of programme titles that are not to be considered as movies.

	Metadata lookup processes a programme initially as a movie and only if the programme is not found on the movie
	database is it processed as a TV series.

	This can create incorrect metadata where a programme that is a TV series fits the criteria for a movie (normally
	that the progamme duration is between certain limits) and there is also a movie that happens to have the same title.

	The list maintained by this dialog is used to exclude programmes from the movie lookup process thereby ensuring that
	they will be processed correctly as TV series.

		Title list

			The current list of programme titles that are not movies. If an entry is selected it will appear in the box
			below the list and can be changed and added or deleted.

		Current Entry

			The entry to be added or deleted.

		Add

			The entry will be added to the list in alphabetical order.

		Delete

			The entry will be deleted.

		OK

			The contents of the list will be saved in the current parameter set. Note that the changes will not be
			permanent until 'Save' or 'Save As' is used on the parameter set in EPG Centre.

		Cancel

			Any updates will be discarded.
