1. Pre-requisites
=================

EPG Collector requires version 4 or later of the .Net Framework to be installed. Any tuner card that is to be used must have a BDA
compatible driver installed.

If collections are to use a tuner card the Visual C++ x86 runtime package also needs to be installed. This is normally already present 
but if not can be obtained from:

2. Changes
==========

	2.1 Per frequency parameters
	============================
	
	Parameters can now be set on a per frequency basis so, for example, different areas and regons can be specifed
	for FreeSat and OpenTV in the same collection.
	
	Many parameters that were on the Advanced tab now appear on the Frequency Parameters dialog which is displayed when a 
	frequency, file or stream is added to the Selected Frequency list.

	2.2. Tuning files
	=================

	The tuning files for UK Terrestrial and Australian Terrestrial broadcasters have been updated. The UK files have been created
	from the website www.ukfree.tv and the Australian files from www.ozdigitaltv.com.

	It may be that some of the tuning file names have changed such that when the UK or Australian parameters are loaded into EPG Centre
	it reports an error indicating that some parameters could not be processed. In this case the parameters will need to be recreated
	using the new tuning files.

	Tuning files containg Dish Network transponders have been updated to use the new modulation of turbo-8psk.

	2.3. Importing files
	====================

	The XMLTV tab in EPG Centre has been renamed Imports and it is now possible to import MXF files created by either EPG Collector
	or BSEPG.

	It is also possible to run a collection with only imported files so, for example, an XMLTV or MXF file can be created on a server
	and EPG Collector run on client machines to import it directly into Windows Media Center without needing to run a collection on 
	the client machine.

	For XMLTV import files it is now possible to specify the format of the channel ID tag.

	2.4. Mono/Wine compatability
	============================

	EPG Centre and EPG Collector are now both compatable with the Mono and Wine environments. EPG Data can be processed from 
	MPEG TS files or from data streamed over a network. 
	
	Sat>IP servers are also supported so these environments can now collect data in real time.

	2.5. Metadata lookups
	=====================

	Poster, banner and fanart are now the image types available for TV series lookups with poster and fanart also being available
	in a thumbnail format which reduces the download time and disc space used.
	
	Poster is a portrait orientation while banner and fanart are both landscape orientations.
	
	TV series images have been rationalised so that only a single image is kept locally, irrespective of how many episodes of the
	series are in the EPG data. Previously each episode would have had a copy of the image held locally so this	change can reduce
	the disc space used for images substantially. 
	
	The change will only affect images that are downloaded with this version of the software onwards. Existing local images
	will be gradually deleted as the matching EPG entries become obsolete.

	TV lookups are now substantially more successful where a broadcaster includes a subtitle or episode title.
	
	2.6. XMLTV output
	=================
	
	There have been some changes made that affect the 'episode-num' tag that is output to an XMLTV file.
	
	The Output tab now has the following options for creating this tag:
	
		Valid season and episode numbers only
		BSEPG compatible
		Full content reference ID
		Numeric part of content reference ID
		Not output

	Valid season and episode numbers are not always available and depend on the data from the broadcaster.

	The options using the content reference ID are also dependent of the data broadcast. These options should
	be used if the software that processes the XMLTV file can use the episode tags in a non-standard format. The system
	attribute is set to 'crid' for the full content reference ID and 'numeric_crid' for the numeric format.
	
	These changes have been made to ensure the file format complies with the XMLTV specification.
	
	2.7. Windows Media Center import
	================================
	
	There is an additional option for specifying how series are creaed and repeats checked when importing directly to Windows
	Media Center.
	
	In previous versions there was an option on the Output tab labeled 'Use Windows Media Center built in repeat checking'. This
	has been replaced with three options available in a list.
	
		Not used

			The programme title is used to control the creation of series. All programmes with the same title will be 
			grouped into the same series.

			Programme repeats within a series will not be detected unless the Repeats tab is used.
			
		Use programme title to generate links
			
			The programme title is used to control the creation of series. All programmes with the same title will be 
			grouped into the same series.

			Programme repeats are detected using the programme title and season and episode numbers. If season and episode
			numbers are not available the programme description is used.
				
		Use broadcaster references to generate links
			
			The links from the broadcaster such as content reference ID's or series links will be used to group programmes
			into series.

			If broadcaster links are not available the programme title will be used.

			Programme repeats are detected using the same information. If content reference ID's or series links are not
			available season and episode numbers will be used. If they are not available the programme title, description and
			start time will be used.
				
			This is the most accurate way to group programmes into seasons and detect repeats.

	Setting the option available in previous versions was the equivalent of selecting 'Use programme title to generate links'.
				
	If the selection in this list is changed it may be necessary to re-create the Windows Media Center database. This option
	cannot be used at the same time as enabling the Repeats tab.
	
	2.8. Channel scans
	==================
	
	It is now possible to ignore tuning errors when carry out channel scans using the Channels or Timeshift tabs.
	
	In some cases the channel scan is used to scan a large number of frequencies some of which may result in tuning errors. An
	option is now available on both the Channels and Timeshift tabs to ignore these errors and continue the scan.
	
	The EPG Collector log can be viewed to determine which frequencies failed.
	
3. Faults fixed
===============
	
	2.1 Australian MHEG5 collections could fail if the broadcaster sent data that was not current.
	
	2.2 The Windows Media Center import could fail when run under Windows 10.

4. Breaking changes
===================

	Every effort has been made to make this release compatible with earlier releases. There is no reason why 
	this version cannot simply be installed and successfully used without changing parameter files or scheduled tasks.

	4.1 UK/Australian terrestrial collections
	 
		As noted in section 2 above, due to updates to the tuning files, it may be necessary to recreate the parameter files for 
		UK or Australian terrestrial collections. This should only be necessary if the parameters need to be loaded into EPG 
		Centre. Existing collections should still work correctly.

	4.2 Windows Media Center import

		If the new Windows Media Center import option 'Use broadcaster references to generate links' the Windows Media Center 
		database will need to be re-created prior to running the first collection with this version.

5. DVBLogic plugin
==================

IMPORTANT - For users of the DVBLogic plugin

DVBLogic users must update the plugin after installation by loading EPG Centre and selecting the 'File' and 'Update DVBLogic 
Plugin Module' menu options. 

In addition, if the plugin has been running prior to carrying out an EPG Collector install, you will need to stop the DVBLinkServer
process using Task Manager or the EPG Collector install will fail because some of the files will be in use. The DVBLinkServer 
process is visible in Task Manger on the Processes tab. On Windows 7 you will need to click 'Show processes from all users' to
see it.

The DVBLinkServer process will restart automatically.

When running EPG Centre to update the DVBLogic plugin it is necessary to have Administrator privileges to be able to update it
because the plugin must be installed in the Windows programs directory structure. The easiest way to ensure this is to use 
'Run as Administrator' when loading EPG Centre. This is available either by right clicking on the desktop icon or by navigating 
to the file EPG Centre.exe and right clicking on it.
